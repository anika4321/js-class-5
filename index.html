            <h1>The ocean: A huge body of salt water that covers most of Earth </h1><br>
            <p>This National Geographic Education article explains that the ocean is a vital part of <br>
            life on Earth, influencing weather, temperature, and the carbon cycle. It also contains 97% <br>
            of the Earth's water and is home to some of the world's oldest creatures.</p><br>
            <h1>Here are some facts about the ocean:</h1>
            <p>.The ocean covers 71% of the Earth's surface.<br> 
            .The ocean contains almost 98% of all the water on Earth.<br> 
            .The ocean is made up of one global ocean, but is traditionally divided <br>
            into five main areas: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern oceans.<br> 
            .The ocean floor is moving.<br> 
            .The ocean is home to some of the world's oldest creatures, including jellyfish and <br>
            horseshoe crabs. <br>
            .The ocean is threatened by human activities, including plastic pollution, <br>lost fishing 
            nets, and ships spilling oil and garbage. </p>

            <h1>From white-gloved waiters to a pop-up restaurant from a Michelin-<br>starred chef, 
                Cunard's new ship Queen Anne epitomises the cruise <br>line's mastery at sea</h1>

            <p>
                Cameras flashed and fireworks cascaded across the Southampton night sky as Cunard's Queen Anne,
                 the cruise line's <br>first new ship in 14 years, departed port for the first time in May 2024. A
                  sleek expression of the new luxury, Queen <br>Anne is also an exemplar of the brand's defining style, 
                  an ability to stay connected to nearly two centuries 
                of seafaring <br>heritage while remaining distinctly of the moment.<br><br>

                World-class talents have contributed to the project, 
                including David Collins Studio, which has worked on brands <br>including the 
                iconic Beverly Wilshire hotel, and Sybille de Margerie, whose credits include Four
                 Seasons, <br>Mandarin Oriental and elite private residences. The meticulous attention
                  to aesthetics extends from intricately etched murals in <br>the Britannia Restaurant
                   to a custom-designed chess set.
